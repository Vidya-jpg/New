When you open “SocialCDEforEclipse View”, the plug-in checks if you are a new user or not. If you are a new user, the plug-in will shows you the registration panel (see Figure 1), otherwise it will shows you the login panel (see Figure 2). Note that the view can be drag to all position of the active page, but it is recommended to put the view on the right-hand side of the editor.

<br/>
<br/>
On registration panel, you can create a new account on a proxy server host. This step can be completed only if you have received from the proxy server admin an email containing:
* The proxy server URL
* The invitation code, automatically generated by the proxy server for all new users.
* The email address associated to the invitation code.


Enter all the aforementioned info in the proper fields; please, note that when you enter the server proxy URL, the plug-in will check if it is online, and, as for the picked username, the plug-in check if it is available or not.
If registration succeeds, the plug-in will show the Login page, with all the fields already set, except for the chosen password.

<br/>
<br/>
On Login panel you can see two checkbox:
* Save password
* Auto login


If you check first checkbox, the plug-in store your password, while, if you check the second checkbox, the plug-in load automatically the home page when the user run the IDE. Note that if you check the “auto login” checkbox, the plug-in will also check automatically “save password.”
The Home panel and all other panels (except Login and Registration) are divided in two section:
* Static section
* Dynamic section

Each image in the static section is a link to switch the other panels, plus the logout.

<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the home panel shows all the services available on the proxy server and their status (activated or not).  Through this panel, an authenticated user, can do the following actions:
* Subscribe to a service 
* Unsubscribe to a service
* See the features allowed to a service .
* See owner skills (by clicking on the![skills](https://github.com/collab-uniba/socialcde4eclipse/blob/master/wikiImage/skills.png?raw=true)image)
* Change the password (by clicking on the![settings](https://github.com/collab-uniba/socialcde4eclipse/blob/master/wikiImage/settings.png?raw=true)image)


As for the skill panel, as of this writing the panel is bound only to the LinkedIn service. Therefore, if you want to use this feature , must activate that service first.  
After activating any service (i.e., click on it and authenticate through the browser), you can choose what feature to activate it, according to your privacy needs. The features to select, of course, depend of the structure of the service.  For example, Figure 5 shows the features available for Facebook. Please note that using the same view, you can also choose to unsubscribe the service selected.

<br/>
<br/>
From the static section you can select the People panel, which shows the following sections:
* **Suggestions.** A list of other registered users, suggested according to several criteria (e.g., friend on Facebook, modified same file, commented an issue reported by another user).
* **Followings.** The list of users who you chose to follow.
* **Followers.** The list of users who have decided to follow you.
* **Hidden.** The list of users that you don’t want to see either suggested  or shown in the timelines.

<br/>
<br/>

By clicking on an user, you can see the User Timeline, a panel where all the posts from the selected user are displayed. On this panel, you can choose to follow, unfollow, and even hide the selected user. Besides, you can see also the user’s skills (currently, only the users-reported skills on LinkedIn are retrieved).

<br/>
<br/>

From the navigation pane the user can select to browse the Home Timeline, which shows all posts from the users that you are following.  This panel also allows you to edit and share a new post with your followers. 
The Iteration Timeline and the Interactive Timeline have the same structure of the Home Timeline, but they have different functions:  with the Iteration  Timeline you can see the posts of the users that have common work item with you, while with the Interactive Timeline you can see the posts of users that have modified the file currently shown in the editor view of the IDE.
