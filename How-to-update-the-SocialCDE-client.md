First, download the last version of the plugin from [here](https://github.com/collab-uniba/socialcde4eclipse/blob/master/it.uniba.di.socialCDEforEclipse/downloadClient/SocialCDEforEclipse.jar?raw=true).

Then, simply overwrite the old jar file  with the new one. The plugin jar is located into the subfolder `dropins/` within your installation directory (e.g, `c:\users\fabio\eclipse` or `/home/fabio/ecplipse`). If you are a Mac OS X user, make sure to right-click the Eclipse icon and pick from menu the _'Show Package Contents'_ entry to see the folders within.

After replacing the jar, run the IDE and, once it has started, it might be possible that you have to enable again the plugin by selecting the menu _'Windows -> Show view -> Others'_ and then browsing for _'SocialCDE for Eclipse'_ in the tree view.
