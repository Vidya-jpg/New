This guides shows you how to properly setup an organization on GitHub, and to define teams with associated projects. These steps can be completed just once by just one member of the team who will invite all the others.

## Create an Organization
To create your organization, go to your GitHub profile and click on _'New Organization'_.

Next, pick the name of the organization (_'SocialCDE-organization'_ in this guide), enter your email address and make sure to pick the free plan! (_'Open Source ($0/month)'_). Then, click green button.

In order to finish the creation, add the other member of your team to the organization (you can add more later if you forget somebody...). Add them one by one, entering their email addresses or GitHub names. Then, click _'Finish'_.

## Crete your Project
Now that your organization has been created, it is time to create a project repository and a team. Let's start from the repository. From the main page of the organization, click on the _'Repositories'_ tab and then on the button _'+ New Repository'_.

Enter the name for your new GitHub repository, **make it public** -- we don't want to pay a thing! Make sure to check the box to create the README.MD file too. If you know what programming languages are going to use, add a `.gitignore` specific for your language (Java in this example). Then, click the green button to create the repo.

## Add a Project Team
Now, we have an organization and a project repository. Let's create a team that contains some or even all of the organization members and give them the rights to modify the project repository.

Click on the _'Teams'_ tab and then on the _'Create new team'_ button.

Pick a name for the team, optionally a description, and then make it visible to others.

Now, start adding people from the organization to the team.

To conclude, click on _'Repositories'_ as shown in the picture, and associate the repository we created above. You simply have to start typing its name and the repo will appear. After adding it ** make sure you give the team either _Write_ or _Admin_ access rights or they won't be able to modify its content**. 

That's it! Happy GitHub coding!
